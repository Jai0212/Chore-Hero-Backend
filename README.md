## Overview
Chore Hero is built using Vite and React for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. The database is managed with MongoDB, ensuring secure and efficient data handling. The frontend and admin websites are hosted on Netlify, while the backend is hosted on Render.
There is also an admin website to control website changes and allow our heroes to add services.

## Usage - Frontend
To experience Chore Hero, visit the website: https://chore-hero.netlify.app/

### Getting Started:
* **Initial Load Time**: Please note that the main services may take about 45 seconds to load initially as the backend activates.

* **Checkout**: After adding the desired services to your cart, proceed to checkout and enter your details.
* **Payment**: You will be redirected to a payment page. Use a Stripe dummy card, which you can find online, to complete the transaction. Your payment will be verified, and your order will be placed.


### Important Notes
* **No Actual Payment**: The payment process is simulated, so no actual transaction will occur.
* **Secure Data**: Although the data will be stored in the database, all your sensitive information, including passwords and personal details, is encrypted and secured using tokenization.
* **Placeholder Data**: The list of heroes on the website is placeholder data.


## Usage - Admin
You can view the admin website from this link: https://chore-hero-admin.netlify.app/  

* **Initial Load Time**: Just like the main website, the admin panel may take about 45 seconds to load initially as the backend activates.
* **Select Hero**: At the top of the admin website, you'll find a dropdown menu. Choose the hero whose admin panel you want to access.
* **Add Services**: You can add a service to the existing list of services from the "Add All Services" tab. This change will be immediately reflected on the main frontend services panel (you might have to reload the frontend website)

NOTE: For any changes made in the admin to be reflected on the frontend, you might have to reload the frontend once.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Netlify and Render thanks to which I was able to host the frontend and backend of my project.

Additionally, the pictures for the various services and the header image were all publicly available on Google and thus were used from there.

**NOTE**: No payment made will actually be fully processed. The heroes are placeholder data and the footer contact details are for show.

I worked on this project alone and will not be actively working on this project anymore (I will be creating other related projects). However, I would love any suggestions/feedback/collaborative requests.
